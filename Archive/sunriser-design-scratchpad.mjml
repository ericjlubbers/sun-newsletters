<h1>Mobile home residents buy the joint / Housing crisis &#8220;wake-up call&#8221; / Rural broadband at 91%</h1>

<p><strong><em>Plus</em></strong><em>: Introducing a new Sun reporter, updates on Olde Town Arvada shooting and more Colorado news</em></p>

<p><strong>Compiled by Eric Lubbers, </strong><a target="_blank"  href="mailto:eric@coloradosun.com?subject=Sunriser+feedback"><strong>eric@coloradosun.com</strong></a><em>, CTO/Newsletter Wrangler, </em><a target="_blank"  href="http://twitter.com/brofax"><em>@brofax</em></a> + <strong>Danika Worthington, </strong><a target="_blank"  href="mailto:danika@coloradosun.com"><strong>danika@coloradosun.com</strong></a><strong>, </strong><em>Presentation Editor</em>, <a target="_blank"  href="http://twitter.com/Dani_Worth">@Dani_Worth</a></p>

<hr />&nbsp;

<p>Good morning and welcome to the longest Wednesday of the year (more or less). According to <a target="_blank"  href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumy/id908905093">Lumy</a>, a great single-purpose app on my phone, my neighborhood saw its first daylight at 5:01 a.m. and won&#8217;t be totally dark until after 9.</p>

<p>All that sun is great for vitamin D production, but not so great for crews battling some of the <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/06/22/colorado-wildfires-2021/">fires burning</a> around Colorado, including the <strong>Muddy Slide Fire</strong> that gave last night&#8217;s Front Range sunset its beautiful and terrible pink haze. Colorado-based <strong>USA Today</strong> reporter <strong>Trevor Hughes</strong> captured a pretty harrowing image of the source of the smoke:</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be updating <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/06/22/colorado-wildfires-2021/">our fire tracker</a> all season long — and it&#8217;s going to be a long season, with no end in sight for the drought in the West or <a target="_blank"  href="https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/the-drought-in-the-west-is-climate">climate-change-fueled</a> <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/19/1008248475/the-record-temperatures-enveloping-the-west-is-not-your-average-heat-wave">heat waves</a> that are setting a gnarly stage for the summer.</p>

<p>But before we dive into the news, we have a new reporter to introduce! On Monday, <strong>Daniel Ducassi</strong> joined The Sun&#8217;s award-winning politics team. He was freelancing in Florida before this and has previously worked for <strong>Politico</strong> and <strong>The Miami Herald</strong>. Daniel hiked the <strong>Camino de Santiago</strong> in Spain a few years ago, where people often mistook him for "el profesor" from the Netflix series "Money Heist." <a target="_blank"  href="mailto:daniel@coloradosun.com">Send him a note</a> to say hello and <a target="_blank"  href="https://twitter.com/dducassi">follow him on Twitter</a>!</p>

<p>OK, today&#8217;s newsletter has good news and bad news about Colorado housing, a neglected part of the state&#8217;s push for broadband and more details about the shooting in Arvada. Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>

<p>The town of Towaoc in southwestern Colorado, the base of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, might look like it has decent broadband according to state maps. But the tribe&#8217;s director of planning and development will tell you that the real-world experience of using broadband in the town isn&#8217;t even close to what the map claims. <strong>Tamara Chuang</strong> has an update on the state&#8217;s rural broadband push, including why <strong>Bernadette Cuthair</strong> and other tribal officials are optimistic about new plans to boost speeds. &gt;&gt; <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/06/23/rural-broadband-ute-mountain-tribes-digital-divide/"><strong>STORY</strong></a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s broadly understood that the lack of housing for the working class and permanent residents in the high country is a bad thing. But as <strong>Jason Blevins</strong> reports, a new survey of thousands of residents of Colorado mountain towns is providing a strikingly clear snapshot of the downstream impacts on the economies, natural resources and sometimes basic functions of these communities. This story also taught me a new concept: the &#8220;mid-term renter&#8221; who doesn&#8217;t pay the tourist fees that fund housing programs but doesn&#8217;t stick around long enough to become a local. &gt;&gt; <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/06/23/cast-nwcog-survey-mountain-town-affordable-housing-crisis/"><strong>STORY</strong></a></p>

<ul><li><strong>Colorado Mountain College to spend $40M to build housing for students.</strong> &gt;&gt; A degree from <strong>CMC</strong> is one of the best deals on higher education in the state — unless you have to rent an apartment in the high country while you go to school. <strong>Jason Blevins</strong> has more on the bold step the college is taking to keep students housed. &gt;&gt; <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/06/22/cmc-adding-affordable-student-housing-mountain-towns/"><strong>STORY</strong></a></li></ul>

<p><strong>Hollywood joins our Books of the West list. </strong>&gt;&gt;<strong> </strong>Should our definition of Books of the West extend all the way to California, even to the La La Land of Hollywood? Reader Steve thinks so, and it&#8217;s hard to argue when you hear the reviews for his recommendation, &#8220;<strong>River of Shadows</strong>,&#8221; by <strong>Rebecca Solnit</strong>. She takes on the amazing truth of early technologist Eadweard Muybridge, the man who made motion pictures possible by capturing high-speed images of galloping horses in the late 1870s. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that Muybridge looks like abolitionist John Brown with a camera in his hands. A blurb says &#8220;the story of Muybridge . . . becomes a lens for a larger story about the acceleration and industrialization of everyday life.&#8221; Don&#8217;t forget to shop locally when you can, <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.tatteredcover.com/50-books-west-0">with Tattered Cover joining us</a> to highlight our 50(ish) Books of the West with their own recommendations. <em>-- Michael Booth </em>&gt;&gt; <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/books-about-the-west/"><strong>Books of the West</strong></a></p>
