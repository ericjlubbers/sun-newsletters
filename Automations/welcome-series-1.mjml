<h3>Q: What is The Colorado Sun?</h3>

<p><strong>A: We&#8217;re a bunch of curious journalists who live here and ask lots of questions.</strong> We vet statistics, trends and complex reports to see what the data is really saying. We listen and observe our community to better understand Colorado — and then write about it.</p>

<h3>Q: That&#8217;s great, but seriously, are you a newspaper or something?</h3>

<p><strong>A: Most of us got our start at newspapers, but The Colorado Sun is something different</strong>. We call ourselves a &#8220;digital news outlet&#8221; but that just means you can find us all over the internet.</p>

<h3>Q: So who funds The Colorado Sun?</h3>

<p><strong>A: You do!</strong> The largest source of The Sun&#8217;s funding by far comes directly from readers like you who become members. Other sources of funding include select local business sponsorships, journalism grants and live events.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re a different type of news business, too. Our operations run lean (most of our money goes right to paying journalists, not to line an investor&#8217;s pockets or maintain a big office). We&#8217;re a public-benefit corporation (<a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/annualreport/?pico=clean">more on what that means</a>) owned by journalists with a mission to serve the public. We don&#8217;t run clickbait or sponsored content and we don&#8217;t use cookies to follow you around the web or ask for your personal data like some other news sites. <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/09/09/sun-third-anniversary-letter-from-editor/?pico=clean">Read our latest annual report</a> for more.</p>

<h3>Q: What does being a member of The Colorado Sun mean?</h3>

<p><strong>A: That you&#8217;re extremely cool and good-looking, for starters</strong>. Being a member also means you believe that local journalism is important enough to support. And each of our membership tiers also comes with some great perks:

<h3>Q: Cool. Anything else you want to tell me?</h3>
