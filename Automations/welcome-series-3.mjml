<p>But really, I wanted to reiterate our journalism. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re here, right?</p>

<p>Our <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/04/29/colorado-sun-top-of-the-rockies-journalism-awards/?pico=clean">award-winning journalists</a> spend a lot of time asking the next question to provide deeply reported stories that Coloradans now rely on as the journalism industry continues to implode.</p>

<p>I just love diving into a <a target="_blank"  href="https://twitter.com/KevinJourno">Kevin Simpson</a> story. He&#8217;s a wonderful wordsmith who captured what it&#8217;s like on a stretch of river along the South Platte that is so full of fish, <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/10/13/dream-stream-repair-project/?pico=clean">it&#8217;s called the &#8220;Dream Stream&#8221;</a> â€” and why there are efforts to restore it.</p>

<p>My colleague <a target="_blank"  href="https://twitter.com/ShannonNajma">Shannon Najmabadi</a> hangs out in all parts of Colorado to dive deeper into rural issues but brings it home when sharing <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/09/13/coloradofarmers-agricultural-supply-chain/?pico=clean">how supply shortages and price hikes</a> are upending farmers and businesses east to west.</p>

<p>And since you&#8217;re new, you probably missed <a target="_blank"  href="https://twitter.com/dducassi">Daniel Ducassi</a>&#8217;s uncovering how a <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/08/06/anschutz-tax-lawsuit-dismissed/?pico=clean">Colorado billionaire sued the state to get a larger tax refund</a>. But he didn&#8217;t let it lie. Danny, that&#8217;s what he goes by, kept digging to find out how much: <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2021/08/06/anschutz-tax-lawsuit-dismissed/?pico=clean">$8 million</a>.</p>
